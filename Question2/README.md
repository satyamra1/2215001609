## Project Status: Incomplete

**Despite completing the major portions of both the backend and frontend for the Social Media Analytics microservice, the project could not be fully tested or deployed due to API-related issues.**

### Issues Faced
1. The **provided API token** resulted in repeated authentication failures.
2. Due to this, I was unable to fetch live data, which affected the functionality of the following endpoint:
   - `/users`
